Alex Schmitt - 09 oct 2016


Goal of the application
========================================================

- How to choose a tree regarding its caracteristics
- Where to find the chosen tree
- Choose another tree...
- Some more eXtra Trees in Jardin des Plantes

How to use the application
========================================================

- Just click on the top plot and a Special Marker will show up on the map below.
- Click on any other tree on the top plot and the Special Marker will show it.
- Or click on the last link to find even more eXtra Trees in Paris

How it works
========================================================

- It's all automatic !
- Catching the clicked point in Plot.ly .
- Converting data from plot.ly to pass it to Leaflet using the same data frame.
- Redrawing Paris map with all the markers including the Special Marker.

Thanks
